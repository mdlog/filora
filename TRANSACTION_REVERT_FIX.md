# Transaction Revert Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

Error: `❌ Transaction reverted. Common causes: ...`

### **Root Cause:** Invalid Seller Address

When you tried to purchase an asset, the transaction reverted because:

```typescript
// In asset detail page:
owner: assetData?.payer || "Unknown"  // ❌ Can be "Unknown"!

// Passed to PurchaseModal:
seller={asset.owner}  // = "Unknown"

// In contract call:
usdfc.transferFrom(msg.sender, to, sellerAmount)  // to = "Unknown" ❌
// This causes revert because "Unknown" is not a valid Ethereum address!
```

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Added Validation in PurchaseModal** 
`components/marketplace/PurchaseModal.tsx`

```typescript
const handlePurchase = async () => {
  // ✅ NEW: Validate seller address BEFORE any transaction
  if (!seller || seller === "Unknown" || seller === "null" || !seller.startsWith("0x")) {
    setError(`❌ Invalid seller address: "${seller}". This asset doesn't have a valid owner recorded.`);
    console.error("❌ Seller validation failed");
    return;  // Stop here - don't attempt transaction
  }

  // ✅ NEW: Validate price
  if (!price || parseFloat(price) <= 0) {
    setError(`❌ Invalid price: "${price}".`);
    return;
  }

  // ✅ NEW: Prevent buying from yourself
  if (seller.toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()) {
    setError("❌ You cannot purchase your own asset!");
    return;
  }

  // ... rest of purchase logic
}
```

### 2. **Added Visual Warning in Asset Detail Page**
`app/assets/[datasetId]/[pieceId]/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Check if owner is valid
const hasValidOwner = asset.owner && 
                      asset.owner !== "Unknown" && 
                      asset.owner !== "null" && 
                      asset.owner.startsWith("0x");

const canPurchase = hasValidOwner && displayPrice && parseFloat(displayPrice) > 0;
```

Now if owner is invalid, users will see:

```
⚠️ Cannot Purchase - Invalid Owner

This asset doesn't have a valid owner address recorded. The asset may have 
been uploaded incorrectly or the ownership data was not properly set. Purchase is disabled.

Owner: Unknown
```

### 3. **Enhanced Logging for Debugging**

Added comprehensive console logging:

```typescript
console.log("🛒 Purchase Debug Info:", {
  buyer: address,
  seller: seller,
  sellerValid: seller && seller !== "Unknown" && seller.startsWith("0x"),
  assetId,
  price,
  usdfcBalance: balances?.usdfcBalanceFormatted,
});
```

---

## 🔍 **How to Debug If Still Failing**

### Step 1: Open Browser Console (F12)

Before clicking "Buy Now", check console logs:

**Look for:**
```
🛒 Purchase Debug Info: {
  buyer: "0xYourAddress...",
  seller: "Unknown",  // ❌ THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
  sellerValid: false,  // ❌ Validation will fail
  assetId: 123,
  price: "1.0",
  ...
}
```

### Step 2: Check Asset Owner in Console

Add this to browser console:
```javascript
// Find the asset data
console.log("Asset owner:", assetData?.payer);
console.log("Is valid?", assetData?.payer && assetData.payer.startsWith("0x"));
```

### Step 3: If Seller is "Unknown"

**Why this happens:**
1. Asset was uploaded without proper ownership tracking
2. `assetData?.payer` is `null` or `undefined`
3. System falls back to `"Unknown"`

**Solutions:**
- ❌ **Cannot purchase this asset** - It has no valid owner
- ✅ **Upload a new asset properly** with ownership tracking
- ✅ **Fix the asset** by re-registering it with correct owner

## 📊 **Transaction Flow (Fixed)**

### Before Fix (FAILED):
```
User clicks "Buy Now"
  ↓
No validation ❌
  ↓
Call processPayment(to="Unknown", amount, tokenId)
  ↓
Contract tries: usdfc.transferFrom(buyer, "Unknown", amount)
  ↓
❌ REVERT: Invalid address "Unknown"
```

### After Fix (SUCCESS):
```
User clicks "Buy Now"
  ↓
Validate seller address ✅
  ↓
If seller="Unknown" → Show error, STOP ✅
  ↓
If seller=valid → Continue
  ↓
Validate price ✅
  ↓
Validate balance ✅
  ↓
Call processPayment(to="0x123...", amount, tokenId)
  ↓
✅ SUCCESS: Transfer to valid address
```

## 🛠️ **Complete Validation Checklist**

The system now checks:

✅ **1. Wallet Connected**
```typescript
if (!address) {
  setError("Please connect your wallet");
  return;
}
```

✅ **2. Valid Seller Address**
```typescript
if (!seller || seller === "Unknown" || !seller.startsWith("0x")) {
  setError("Invalid seller address");
  return;
}
```

✅ **3. Valid Price**
```typescript
if (!price || parseFloat(price) <= 0) {
  setError("Invalid price");
  return;
}
```

✅ **4. Not Buying from Yourself**
```typescript
if (seller.toLowerCase() === address.toLowerCase()) {
  setError("Cannot buy your own asset");
  return;
}
```

✅ **5. Sufficient USDFC Balance**
```typescript
if (usdfcBalance < priceWei) {
  setError("Insufficient USDFC balance");
  return;
}
```

✅ **6. Sufficient tFIL for Gas**
- Checked by MetaMask during transaction

- "Buy Now" button **disabled** if owner invalid
- Button text changes to "❌ Purchase Unavailable"
- Clear explanation: "Asset doesn't have valid owner"

### Purchase Modal:

**Before:**
- No validation until transaction
- Generic error messages
- Hard to debug failures

**After:**
- ✅ **Validation before transaction**
- ✅ **Detailed error messages**
- ✅ **Comprehensive console logging**
- ✅ **User-friendly explanations**

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Test Case 1: Asset with Invalid Owner

1. Go to asset with owner = "Unknown"
2. ✅ Should see warning: "Cannot Purchase - Invalid Owner"
3. ✅ Buy button should be disabled
4. ✅ Cannot open purchase modal

**Expected:** No transaction attempt, clear error shown

### Test Case 2: Asset with Valid Owner

1. Go to asset with owner = "0x123..."
2. ✅ No warning shown
3. ✅ Buy button enabled
4. Click "Buy Now"
5. ✅ Purchase modal opens
6. ✅ Transaction processes successfully

**Expected:** Purchase completes normally

### Test Case 3: Try to Buy Your Own Asset

1. Go to YOUR uploaded asset
2. Click "Buy Now"
3. ✅ Error: "You cannot purchase your own asset!"

**Expected:** Transaction blocked with friendly message

## 📝 **For Asset Uploaders**

To ensure your assets are purchasable:

### ✅ **Correct Upload Process:**

1. **Connect wallet** before uploading
2. **Complete all MetaMask transactions**:
   - USDFC approval
   - Storage setup
   - File upload
   - Asset registry
3. **Wait for confirmations** (don't close browser)
4. **Verify asset appears** in "My Assets"
5. **Check owner address** is your wallet address

### ❌ **Common Upload Mistakes:**

- Closing browser before upload completes
- Rejecting MetaMask transactions
- Insufficient USDFC for storage
- Insufficient tFIL for gas
- Network disconnection during upload

### 🔍 **Verify Your Asset:**

After uploading, check:
```javascript
// In browser console on your asset page
console.log("Owner:", asset.owner);
console.log("Is valid?", asset.owner && asset.owner.startsWith("0x"));
```

If owner = "Unknown" → Asset upload failed, try again

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

### If Transaction Still Reverts:

1. **Check console logs:**
   - Look for validation errors
   - Check seller address value
   - Verify all checks pass

2. **Verify on block explorer:**
   - Go to: https://calibration.filfox.info/en
   - Search your wallet address
   - Find the failed transaction
   - Read error message

3. **Common Remaining Issues:**
   - Approval not confirmed (wait longer, try again)
   - Insufficient USDFC (get more from faucet)
   - Insufficient tFIL (get more from faucet)
   - Network congestion (wait and retry)

4. **Provide debug info:**
   ```
   - Asset ID (datasetId)
   - Your wallet address (first 6 + last 4)
   - Seller address shown
   - Price shown
   - Console logs
   - Transaction hash
   ```
