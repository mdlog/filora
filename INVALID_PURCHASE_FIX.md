# Invalid Purchase Fix - Prevents Failed Transactions from Being Recorded

## 🐛 **Problem Reported**

**Issue:** Buy process failed, tapi asset tetap muncul di halaman "Purchased"

**Root Cause:** 
- Asset ditambahkan ke localStorage bahkan ketika payment transaction gagal
- Tidak ada validation untuk memastikan payment benar-benar berhasil sebelum record purchase
- User melihat asset di "Purchased" tab padahal sebenarnya tidak membeli

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Added Payment Validation**

**Before (Bug):**
```typescript
const result = await processPayment.mutateAsync({ ... });

// ❌ Langsung add tanpa check!
await addPurchase({ ... });
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
const result = await processPayment.mutateAsync({ ... });

// ✅ Check dulu apakah payment berhasil!
if (!result || !result.paymentHash) {
  throw new Error("Payment transaction failed");
}

// ✅ Only add if payment succeeded
await addPurchase({ ... });
```

### **2. Enhanced Error Handling**

**Added explicit warnings:**
```typescript
catch (error) {
  console.error("❌ Purchase failed:", error);
  
  // ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT add to purchased if payment failed!
  console.warn("⚠️ Purchase was NOT recorded because payment failed");
  
  // Show clear error to user
  setError("Transaction failed. No charges made.");
}
```

### **3. Added Cleanup Functions**

**New functions in `usePurchasedAssets`:**

```typescript
// Remove specific purchase
removePurchase(datasetId, pieceId);

// Clear all purchases
clearAllPurchases();
```

---

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **File: `components/marketplace/PurchaseModal.tsx`**

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added validation: Check if `result.paymentHash` exists
2. ✅ Throw error if payment failed
3. ✅ Only call `addPurchase()` AFTER payment confirmed
4. ✅ Enhanced error messages with helpful context
5. ✅ Added console warnings for failed purchases
6. ✅ Added small delay before closing modal (1s)

**Code:**
```typescript
// Process payment
const result = await processPayment.mutateAsync({ to, amount, tokenId });

// ✅ NEW: Validate payment succeeded
if (!result || !result.paymentHash) {
  throw new Error("Payment transaction failed - no transaction hash");
}

console.log("✅ Payment completed successfully!");
console.log("📝 Payment transaction hash:", result.paymentHash);

// ✅ Only add to purchased AFTER validation
await addPurchase({ 
  datasetId, 
  pieceId, 
  pieceCid, 
  price, 
  seller,
  purchasedAt: Date.now() / 1000,
  txHash: result.paymentHash  // ✅ Include transaction hash
});
```

### **File: `hooks/usePurchasedAssets.ts`**

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `removePurchase(datasetId, pieceId)` function
2. ✅ Added `clearAllPurchases()` function
3. ✅ Export new functions

**New Functions:**
```typescript
// Remove specific invalid purchase
const removePurchase = (datasetId: number, pieceId: number) => {
  console.log("🗑️ Removing purchase:", { datasetId, pieceId });
  
  const updated = purchases.filter(
    p => !(p.datasetId === datasetId && p.pieceId === pieceId)
  );
  
  setPurchases(updated);
  localStorage.setItem(`${STORAGE_KEY}_${address}`, JSON.stringify(updated));
};

// Clear all purchases (for debugging/reset)
const clearAllPurchases = () => {
  console.log("🗑️ Clearing all purchases");
  setPurchases([]);
  localStorage.removeItem(`${STORAGE_KEY}_${address}`);
};
```

## 🔍 **How to Identify Invalid Purchases**

### **Console Logs to Check:**

**Successful Purchase (Correct):**
```javascript
🛒 Starting purchase process...
Processing payment: { ... }
Step 1: Approving USDFC...
✅ Approval tx sent: 0x...
Step 2: Processing payment...
✅ Payment tx sent: 0x...
✅ Payment completed successfully!
📝 Payment transaction hash: 0xabc123...
✅ Purchase recorded to localStorage!
```

**Failed Purchase (Should NOT be in Purchased tab):**
```javascript
🛒 Starting purchase process...
Processing payment: { ... }
Step 1: Approving USDFC...
❌ Purchase failed: [error message]
⚠️ Purchase was NOT recorded because payment failed  // ← Key indicator
```

### **Check localStorage:**

Open browser console (F12):
```javascript
// Check what's stored
const address = "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS";
const stored = localStorage.getItem(`filora_purchased_assets_${address}`);
console.log("Purchases:", JSON.parse(stored));
```

**Valid Purchase Entry:**
```json
{
  "datasetId": 37,
  "pieceId": 0,
  "pieceCid": "bafk...",
  "seller": "0xabc...",
  "price": "1.0",
  "purchasedAt": 1728234567,
  "txHash": "0xdef456..."  // ← Should have transaction hash
}
```

**Invalid Purchase Entry (Missing txHash):**
```json
{
  "datasetId": 42,
  "pieceId": 0,
  "pieceCid": "bafk...",
  "seller": "0xabc...",
  "price": "1.0",
  "purchasedAt": 1728234999,
  "txHash": undefined  // ← Missing! This is invalid
}
```

## 🧹 **How to Clean Invalid Purchases**

### **Method 1: Remove Specific Purchase (Console)**

Open browser console (F12):
```javascript
// 1. Get your wallet address
const address = "0xYourAddress...";

// 2. Load purchases
const key = `filora_purchased_assets_${address}`;
let purchases = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || '[]');

// 3. Show current purchases
console.log("Current purchases:", purchases);

// 4. Remove specific purchase (e.g., dataset 37, piece 0)
purchases = purchases.filter(p => !(p.datasetId === 37 && p.pieceId === 0));

// 5. Save back
localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(purchases));

// 6. Refresh page
location.reload();
```

### **Method 2: Clear All Purchases (Console)**

```javascript
// Get your wallet address
const address = "0xYourAddress...";

// Clear all purchases
localStorage.removeItem(`filora_purchased_assets_${address}`);

// Refresh page
location.reload();
```

### **Method 3: Use Hook Functions (In Code)**

If you want to add UI buttons to clear purchases:

```typescript
import { usePurchasedAssets } from "@/hooks/usePurchasedAssets";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { removePurchase, clearAllPurchases } = usePurchasedAssets();

  return (
    <>
      {/* Remove specific purchase */}
      <button onClick={() => removePurchase(37, 0)}>
        Remove Invalid Purchase
      </button>

      {/* Clear all purchases */}
      <button onClick={clearAllPurchases}>
        Clear All Purchases (Debug)
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

## 🔐 **Safety Measures**

### **1. Payment Hash Validation**
- Must have valid transaction hash to record purchase
- If no hash → transaction didn't complete

### **2. Try-Catch Protection**
- All purchase logic wrapped in try-catch
- Errors don't leak into storage

### **3. Console Warnings**
- Explicit warnings when purchase fails
- Easy to debug with console logs

### **4. User-Friendly Errors**
- Clear messages explain what happened
- Actionable advice (get more tokens, wait, retry)

---

## 📋 **Console Messages Guide**

### **✅ Success Messages:**
```javascript
✅ Payment completed successfully!
📝 Payment transaction hash: 0x...
✅ Purchase recorded to localStorage!
```

**Meaning:** Purchase successful, safe to proceed

### **❌ Error Messages:**
```javascript
❌ Purchase failed: [reason]
⚠️ Purchase was NOT recorded because payment failed
```

**Meaning:** Purchase failed, NOT added to storage (correct behavior)

### **🔍 Debug Messages:**
```javascript
🛒 Purchase Debug Info: { ... }
💰 Balance check: { ... }
📋 Transaction parameters: { ... }
```

**Meaning:** Diagnostic info for debugging

## 🆘 **If You Have Invalid Purchases**

### **Symptoms:**
- Asset in "Purchased" tab but no transaction hash
- Purchase shows but wasn't actually paid for
- Buy failed but asset still appears

### **Quick Fix:**

1. **Open console** (F12)
2. **Check purchases:**
   ```javascript
   const addr = "YOUR_ADDRESS";
   const purchases = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`filora_purchased_assets_${addr}`));
   console.table(purchases);
   ```

3. **Look for entries without `txHash`**

4. **Clear invalid ones:**
   ```javascript
   // Option A: Remove all
   localStorage.removeItem(`filora_purchased_assets_${addr}`);
   location.reload();
   
   // Option B: Remove specific
   const valid = purchases.filter(p => p.txHash);
   localStorage.setItem(`filora_purchased_assets_${addr}`, JSON.stringify(valid));
   location.reload();
   ```

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Fix works correctly if:
- ✅ Failed purchases do NOT appear in "Purchased" tab
- ✅ Only successful purchases are recorded
- ✅ All purchases have valid `txHash`
- ✅ Clear error messages on failure
- ✅ No phantom purchases
